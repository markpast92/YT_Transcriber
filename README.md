# User Guide for YouTube Audio Extractor & Transcriber

## Audio Extraction
1. Paste the YouTube video URL in the input field
2. Select the destination folder (optional)
3. Click on "Extract Audio"
4. Wait for the download and extraction to complete

## Transcription Generation
1. Make sure the "Generate content transcription" checkbox is selected
2. Choose the transcription model:
   - `tiny`: Very fast, limited accuracy (~150MB)
   - `base`: Good compromise for short videos (~300MB)
   - `small`: Recommended for general use (~500MB)
   - `medium`: High accuracy, slower (~1.5GB)
   - `large`: Maximum accuracy, very slow (~3GB)
3. Click on "Extract Audio"
4. Wait for the transcription to complete

## Transcription Management
- Use the "Copy Transcription" button to copy the text to the clipboard
- Use the "Save Transcription" button to save the text to a .txt file

## Tips for Optimal Use
- For short videos (less than 5 minutes), the `base` model offers a good balance between speed and accuracy
- For content in languages other than English, it is recommended to use at least the `small` model
- The first run will be slower because it downloads the necessary models
- Close other heavy applications during transcription to improve performance

## Common Troubleshooting
- If the app freezes during download, check your internet connection and restart
- If the transcription is inaccurate, try a larger model or check the audio quality
- If audio extraction fails, check that the URL is correct and the video is accessible
